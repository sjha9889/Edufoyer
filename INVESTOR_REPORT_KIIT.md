- Infra/ops: 96,000 × ₹16 = ₹15.36 lakh
- Contribution (Gross Profit): ₹36.48 lakh
- EBITDA:
  - Lean OPEX (₹24L): ₹12.48 lakh
  - Moderate OPEX (₹48L): −₹11.52 lakh

> Interpretation: With usage billing, Lean OPEX produces positive monthly cash from Month 1. Moderate OPEX requires price lift, volume growth, or cost reduction to turn monthly positive.

## Alternative Reference – Per‑Student Annual Plan (for comparison)
- Price: ₹79/student/month billed annually (₹948/year).
- ARR at 40,000 students: ₹3.792 crore.
- Expected usage still ~96,000 doubts/year → variable cost ≈ ₹69.1L.
- Contribution ≈ ₹3.101 crore.
- EBITDA:
  - Lean OPEX: ₹2.861 crore
  - Moderate OPEX: ₹2.621 crore
- Cash terms example (70% prepay): ₹2.654 crore upfront; remaining 30% over 12 months. This model is substantially more profitable due to pooled credits.

## Sensitivity (Usage-Based)
- Conservative (15% MAU, 0.8 doubts/active): ~4,800 doubts/month → revenue ₹5.28L/month, contribution ₹1.82L/month.
- Aggressive (30% MAU, 1.2 doubts/active): ~14,400 doubts/month → revenue ₹15.84L/month, contribution ₹5.47L/month.

## Valuation Range (Indicative)
- Usage-based at KIIT: Revenue ₹1.056 cr; EBITDA (Lean) ~₹12.48L → 8–12× EBITDA ≈ ₹1.0–₹1.5 cr. Revenue multiple at 1–2×: ₹1.06–₹2.11 cr.
- Per‑student plan: ARR ₹3.792 cr → 2–3× ARR = ₹7.6–₹11.4 cr baseline; EBITDA multiple suggests higher.

## KPIs & SLAs
- SLA: First response < 10 minutes; Quality score > 95%.
- Adoption: 15–30% MAU; Session CSAT > 4.6/5; Doubt resolution time trending down.
- Academic integrity: Moderation, screen watermarking, logs.

## Profit Levers
- Keep pooled credits and monthly/quarterly expiry in annual plans; price overage ≥ ₹60/doubt.
- Guided intake + AI pre‑assist to reduce minutes and shift large→medium/small.
- Route to top solvers; incentives for speed + quality.
- Surge pricing for exam peaks; premium SLA as a paid add‑on.

## Glossary
- ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue.
- MAU: Monthly Active Users.
- Contribution: Revenue − variable (solver + infra) costs.
- EBITDA: Contribution − fixed operating expenses.
- Overage: Usage beyond included allowance charged per doubt.
