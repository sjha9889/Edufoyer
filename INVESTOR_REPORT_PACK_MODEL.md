- Variable cost/doubt: ₹72 (= ₹56 + ₹16)
- Contribution/doubt: ₹38
- Contribution margin: 34.5%

## Per 500‑Doubt Pack Economics
- Revenue: 500 × 110 = ₹55,000
- Solver payouts: 250×40 + 150×60 + 100×90 = ₹28,000
- Infra/ops: 500 × 16 = ₹8,000
- Profit per pack: ₹55,000 − ₹28,000 − ₹8,000 = **₹19,000**

## Valuation Bands (Indicative)
- Revenue multiple (early stage): 1.0–2.0× revenue

- EBITDA multiple (if contribution ≈ EBITDA): 8–12×
  - 20k doubts → ₹7.6L profit → ₹60.8–₹91.2L valuation

## Risks & Levers (to improve profit within same model)
- Pricing levers: exam‑peak surge, priority SLA add‑on, subject/urgency pricing.
- Cost levers: guided intake + AI pre‑assist to reduce minutes (shift Large→Medium/Small).
- Supply levers: route to top solvers; performance‑based incentives for speed/quality.
- Commercials: prepaid multi‑packs; minimum commits; overage ≥ variable cost (₹72+).

## Simple Cash Flow Template (Fill with your months)
- Cash In = Packs sold × ₹55,000 (timing depends on billing terms)
- Cash Out (variable) = Doubts delivered × ₹72
- Net before OPEX = Cash In − Cash Out
- Net after OPEX = Net before OPEX − Fixed OPEX

## Glossary
- Contribution: Revenue − variable costs (solver + infra/ops)
- OPEX: Fixed operating expenses (team, tools, sales, support)
- EBITDA: Contribution − OPEX (proxy for operating profit)
